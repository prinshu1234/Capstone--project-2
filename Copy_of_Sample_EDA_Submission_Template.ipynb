EDA techniques, statistical methods, and visualization tools are used to extract meaningful patterns and trends, enhancing the understanding of the industry.                   \n",

        "Our initial focus was on EDA to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset. This involved examining data distributions, identifying outliers, and assessing the basic characteristics of each feature. We employed descriptive statistics, histograms, and correlation matrices to unveil relationships between variables, laying the groundwork for more in-depth analyses.                                                                  \n",

        "Cancellations and No-Shows:\n",
        "\n",
        "2.) Explored factors contributing to cancellations, such as lead time, guest demographics, and reservation channel. Developed insights to mitigate cancellations and reduce revenue loss.                            \n",
        "\n",
        "3.) Explored the behavior of repeated guests, understanding their preferences and tailoring services to enhance loyalty.                    \n",
        "\n",
        "4.) Investigated factors influencing revenue, such as room type, additional services, and deposit types, offering opportunities for revenue optimization.                                                              \n",
